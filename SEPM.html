          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">"Software (engineering) project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects. It requires knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle: defining the vision, planning the tasks, gathering the people who will do the work, estimating the effort, creating the schedule, overseeing the work, gathering the requirements, designing and programming the software, and testing the end product" (Stellman & Greene, 2005).</p>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">SEPM is a broad term used to define how the project should be undertaken in order to provide best outcome, considering multiple factors as stated in the above citation. Therefore, throughout the course we will focus on the various aspects of software management principles, including practical and real case scenarios.</p>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;font-weight: bold;padding-left: 0px;">Main management responsibilites of a project manager:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1px;">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Requirements: </b>PM (Project manager) has to work with business architects and analysts.</li>

            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">Second week continued with the famous project failures and its causes. This allowed us to understand the importance of different SEPM phases. For example:</p>
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1px;">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Planning: </b> First phase of the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) consist of requirements gathering. This phase evaluates the feasiblity of the project, including potential revenue and costs of production.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Analysis: </b> Based on factors derived from the planning phase the SDLC continues with the analysis and further evaluation of desired outcome.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Design: </b> The design phase shifts the ideas onto paper, ultimately focusing on developing the product. In addition, it includes multiple testing requirements.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Implementation: </b> During the implementation phase, our final product is delivered to intended users. This process can be automated to enhance the continuous maintenance phase.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Maintenance: </b> <b style="font-weight: 500;color: black;">The final phase for the waterfall approach, while in agile approach the phase just resembles further development.</b></li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">*Requirements: </b> <b style="font-weight: 500;color: black;">Gathering requirements is often seen as standalone phase, yet it can also be seen as a phase that overlaps throughout entire software development lifecycle.</b></li>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0em;color: black;padding-left: 0px;">In addition, we took a look at the Gherkin language which consist of a plain-text with a simple structure. It is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of test scenarios and examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains.

        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In unit 3, we identified risk assessment frameworks, multiple estimating methods and planning tools. These tools allowed us to understand the importance of efficient management, since they enable us to minimize potential risks and delays.</p>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;font-weight: bold;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Estimating methods:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 0em;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">The Mythical Man Month: </b> Study from 1975 proposed that even if longer hours have diminishing returns, the organizational overhead from adding people to the team is worse - fewer people with longer hours is the better alternative.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">COCOMO: </b> Constructive Cost Model is based on the number of lines of code and consists of three categories:
              <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1px;">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Organic: </b> Consisting of small development teams in familiar, in-house environments working on well defined and understood projects.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Semi Detached: </b> An intermediate mode between organic and embedded (defined by either project complexity or approach).</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Embedded: </b> Operates within defined constraints, such as those driven by regulations, operational procedures and/or hardware and software complexity.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Function Points: </b> This estimation can be produced much earlier in the lifecycle, even in the design phases. In addition, the model is constructed so that less technical staff can follow the instructions and produce an estimate.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Expert Judgement: </b> Relies on the expert’s opinion to estimate quantitative project details, such as timelines and potential resources. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), expert judgement is one of the most common project management planning tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-left: 0px;margin-bottom: 3vh;">(Lecturecasts, 2023), (Raeburn, 2023), (Hacker News, 2016)</p>

          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;font-weight: bold;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Planning tools:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 0em;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Gantt Charts: </b> A Gantt chart provides an ideal repository for key project information such as wbs codes, milestones and project dates. It also provides a clear visual indication of progress, resources and visual indication of resource utilisation.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">CPM and PERT: </b> Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path Method (CPM) are both useful tools when planning and controlling a project. PERT and CPM are complementary and both are important analytical techniques in project management when managing tasks.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">CCPM: </b> This project management method comes into force after the initial project schedule is prepared, which includes establishing task dependencies. The evolved critical path is reworked based on the Critical Chain Method. To do so, the methodology assumes constraints related to each task.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Software reuse: </b> Code that is not created from a scratch, consequently impacts on the estimation methods. However there may be need for additional testing to meet code compatibility with existing components.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">RMP: </b> The Risk Management Process is a clearly defined method of understanding what risks and opportunities are present, how they could affect a project or organization, and how to respond to them. 4 essential steps are: Identifying the risk, assessing the risk, treating the risk and monitoring and reporting on the risk.</li>

        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In the fourth week the focus was on practical examples of using the planning and estimating tools/methods. For that reason, we had to write an example of Python program that implemented one of the estimated methods (Under homework section).</p>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-top: 2vh;margin-bottom: 0em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Additionally, we discussed main risks that are present in global software development (Under homework section). </p>

        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Objectives that were covered in unit 5 were related to the concepts of usability and user experience (UX).
            Furthermore, there are different understandings of usability, hence we examined various metrics to measure UX. Through the exploration of Python's build-in capabilities of test-driven development, we were able to acknowledge the importance of testing which supports better user experience.</p>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Since the UX is inherently related to the efficency of project management, the manager should strive 
            to be analytical, creative, patient and task-oriented, have good listening, stress management and organizational skills. According to Artisan (N.D.)
            a good ux project manager should also be able to manage details while seeing the big picture and drive a team to achieve desired outcome.</p>
            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;font-weight: bold;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Common methods to collect UX data include:</p>
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Persona building: </b> Involves creating fictional character which can help to identify the needs of regular users interacting with the system. Moreover, automated data analytics tools are almost indispensable asset for data gathering.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Journey mapping: </b> Is respresents, how users navigate through the sites or products. It is a way to visually illustrate the user experience and its goals and motivations.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Pluralistic walkthrough: </b> A pluralistic walkthrough identifies usability issues in a piece of software or website, with the goal of ensuring that the interface is as usable as possible.</li>           
          </ul>
            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Each of these strategies indicate the way that a user might use a product and the way that they actually interact with it in reality, which all contribute towards user experience expectations and satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;font-weight: bold;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Common metrics to measure UX include:</p>

          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">Software development lifecyle (SDLC) includes efficient cost management and planning to build high quality software product.
            The goal of SDLC is to meet the client's expectations and requirements through well managed risks. SDLC allows us to achieve the best possible outcomes, through the use of multiple SDLC stages:</p>
          
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1px;">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Collecting Requirements: </b>With Volere approach which is detailed framework, we can reach up to 90 pages.<p style="margin-left: 11em;margin-bottom: 0px;"> It's main purpose is to capture detailed requirements of the clients and use them together with the development team's perspective.</p>
              <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;" class="hyphen1">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 11.2em;"><b class="boldBlack">Functional Requirements:</b> What the system will do</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 11.2em;"><b class="boldBlack">Non-Functional Requirements:</b> How the system will do.</li>
              </ul>  
            </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Analysis of Requirements: </b>Once the requirements have been gathered from the customer, they are analysed, documented, validated and managed.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Design: </b>After analysing the requirements of a system, the core tasks are then identified and can be organised in a way that captures deliverables of a project.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Development: </b> The actual design gets implemented in the development phase. This phase is supported with iterative development and the use of version control systems. This allows various teams to collaborate within single environement, consequently achieving and utilizing DevOps practices.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Testing: </b>For one of the final stages, a variety of testing approaches should be considered to follow best practices:
              <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;" class="hyphen1">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 4em;"><b class="boldBlack">Unit:</b> Unit testing is the first round of testing, and the focus is on the specific components to determine if each one is fully functional.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 4em;"><b class="boldBlack">Integration:</b> With integration testing, each of the individual units will be combined so that they may be tested as a group. The goal is to identify interface defects between the functions.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 4em;"><b class="boldBlack">System:</b> System testing is when the complete application is tested as a whole, helping to ensure compatibility across the entire system.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 4em;"><b class="boldBlack">Acceptance:</b> Finally, acceptance testing is carried out to assess if the system is ready for release.</li>
              </ul>  
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;font-weight: bold;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Types of development approaches:</p>
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;" class="hyphen1">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Test-driven development (TDD):</b> As stated by Acosta & Gajda (N.D.) "TDD, which is rooted in extreme programming, is all about satisfying your team that the code works as expected for a behavior or use case. Instead of aiming for the optimum solution in the first pass, the code and tests are iteratively built together one use case at a time". TDD approach prioritizes testing the cases before they are compiled into one piece.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Behaviour-driven Development (BDD):</b> BDD relys on the idea that everyone involved are aware of what can be achieved and can be done to meet the requirements. For example, there could be requirements that can't be fulfilled, hence BDD effectively address the expectations of stakeholders and possibilities of development team. </li>
            </ul>  
            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> In addition, we often forget the importance of project clousure/handover. This can often unintentionally and without awarness contributes to unnecessary worries and time consumption. This includes letting the team know that they can move on the other project. Once the task gets completed, one should hold a close meeting, to see if the work that has been done can help others as well. In addition, it is the opportunity to discuss what can be done differently next time. Finally, project documentation should be properly filled.</p>
            <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;font-weight: bold;"> Common mistakes made during software engineering:</p>
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1px;">
              
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Coding stars immediately: </b> When we immediately start to code, it can often happen that we unintentionally miss the requirements. This can later result into re-work.</li>             
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Unsystematic or insufficient testing: </b> Similarly, The code not tested directly compromises the user experience.</li>             
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Requirements not determined: </b> It is important that everyone involved is on the common ground, to prevent further misunderstandings.</li>             
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Ignored standards and regulations: </b> Product that doesn't comply with the law is often be unusable.</li>             
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Inadequate documentation: </b> Reasons why the decisions were made in a certain way should be properly documented. If not, it is often easier to develop new software.</li>

        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> In unit 8, we took a look at the most common data structures and Algorithms. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Dictionary: </b> Dictionaries are Python’s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">List: </b> A list is defined as an ordered collection of items. A list can also be nested and it's mutable.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Tuples: </b> A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that is an ordered collection of objects. Unlike lists, tuples come with limited functionality, for example they are not mutable. </li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Set: </b> A set is defined as a unique collection of unique elements that do not follow a specific order. Sets are used when the existence of an object in a collection of objects is more important than the number of times it appears or the order of the objects </li>          
        </ul>          
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> Algorithms are steps used to complete certain tasks. For example:</p>
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Mark/sweep algorithm: </b> An algorithm for garbage collection. All accessible variables, and any space that is reachable by a chain of pointers from any accessible variable, is “marked”. Then a sequential sweep of all memory in the pool is made. Any unmarked memory locations are assumed to not be needed by the program and can be considered as free to be reused.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Jump search : </b> An algorithm for searching a sorted list, that falls between sequential search and binary search in both computational cost and conceptual complexity.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Monte Carlo algorithms: </b> A form of randomized algorithm. We find the maximum value fast, or we don’t get an answer at all (but fast). While such algorithms have good running time, their result is not guaranteed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> Technical debt is common occurance in software development, hence in this unit we focused on the significance of quality planning and its metrics. Quality is a critical aspect of project management and is one element of the triple constraint that needs to be carefully managed, given its dependence on time, cost and scope. On the other hand, technical debt is the implied cost incurred when businesses do not fix problems that will affect them in the future. </p>
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;font-weight: bold;padding-left: 0px;"> Quality management can be considered from three perspectives:</p>
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Quality planning: </b> Quality planning in the software engineering would ideally resemble the strategies and objectives of a company. </li>             
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Quality assurance: </b> This stage assures that standards are met. This allows us to comply with the best practices of software development.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Quality control: </b> Includes testing and validating the final product against the agreed standards and requirements as specified by the customer.</li>             
        </ul>       
        
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;font-weight: bold;padding-left: 0px;"> Quality metrics recommended by International Electronical Commission (IEC) and International Organization Standardisation (ISO):</p>
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 0em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Functionality</li>             
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Reliability</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Effectiveness</li>             
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Usability</li>             
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Maintainability</li>             
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"> Portability</li>             
        </ul>       
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> Above quality metrics ensure that products and services are safe, reliable and high quality (ISO, N.D.). </p>

        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> The focus of 10th unit was on the use of Pylinters and how they can contribute to the code quality. As stated by Python creator Rossum (N.D.) "Code is read much more often than it is written" hence we sholdn't neglect the benefits of a code that is well structured and easy to understand. Four main recommendations to follow best practices are: </p>
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 0em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Using the tools: </b> Tools such as IDEs, linters, and auto formatting modules can:

              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Make writing clean code easier</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Make writing your code quicker</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Make your code easier to test</li>

        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;"> Since the software principles continuously change, modern trends lean toward Open systems. These typically entails code reuse,
           shared APIs and challenges around legal, ethnical, social aspects of a system. Moreover future trends of Project management inculde: </p>

          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Risk & knowledge management: </b> </li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Planning for change: </b> Project manager is required to be able to manage multiple different actors and resources. 
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">DevOps and AIOPs: </b> Traditionally, a PM would have to be present at the meetings with multiple stakeholders, testing team, development team consequently being short on time to manage the projects. Nowadays this is changing as the DevOps mechanism seems to alleviate the job of PM, combining all involved teams into common pool of project management operations. Modern technologies allow us to automate and monitor the systems, hence the feedback of a system can be easily captured and immediately send to everyone involved. Therefore, the modern role of a software engineer project is to:
             
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 0em;" class="hyphen1">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b>Work with change managers to develop new processes that complement those already used within organisation.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Work with managers and other staff to educate, inform and enthuse staff to adopt DevOps culture. </li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;margin-left: 7.3em;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Constantly looking to utilize suitable tools that will fit into an organisation and enhance their business.</li>
            </ul>
            In recent years, AI has also made a notable impact. With the use of AI, we are able to optimise the operations even more, consequently making a SEPMs life much easier.
