        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">In the first week, we got introduced to various research methods and practices that allowed us to understand the purpose of researches' as well as how to follow best practices while conducting one. Furthermore, main focus was on understanding the discipline itself, so that future work could be properly attained. Therefore the focus was on understanding the following concepts, methods and terms:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Deduction: </b>Defined as logical approach where a research goes from general ideas to specific conclusions. It's an approach to rest existing theory.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Induction: </b>In contrast to the deductive approach, the inductive aims to go from specific observations to broader generalization, therefore, this approach allows us to generate and develop new theory.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Key Principles of Research Ethics: </b>
              <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Respect: </b> This is one of the main research ethics principle, as it applies directly to the participants of a research. As a researchers, we should be aware that making participants anonymous is crucial, in order to avoid any sensitive data disclosure. In addition, their decision to participate should be voluntary and respected with all regards.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Beneficence: </b> Is the balance between research benefits and risks inflicted on participants. As researchers, we should therefore strive to minimize the latter and maximize the former.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Justice: </b> Refers to the fair treatment of all participants. For example, this can be easily violated if the sample is not properly acquired. </li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Respect for Law & Public Interest: </b> Refers to the legal obligations that a researcher should adhere to. This allows one to make an research that holds to the well established standards, ultimately enhancing it's validity.</li>
                
              </ul>
            </li>

      <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 2</p>
      
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%; text-align: justify;">In unit 2, we examined the purpose
          of literature reviews and research proposals which helped us to follow best practices during research.
          We began by focusing on research questions, which are central part to any research project. These questions should therefore be focused, clear and concise. Their primary purpose is to guide the writing process, ensuring a structured and coherent content.</p>
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%; text-align: justify;">Guidlines when considering research design and its questions:</p>

        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;margin-left: 1.5em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Relevant context: </b> When doing a research we should consider our own situation and the purpose of doing certain research. Therefore, the content should be ideally related to the topic of our profession.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Interesting and appropriate topic: </b> A researcher should ideally take the topic in which he feels genuine interest, as this would allow him to delve into the details of that topic.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Preliminary research: </b> A preliminary research should be done to assess what has been done so far. Additionally, this would help one to narrow down the questions and dive into an unexplored or not so well supported findings.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Audience: </b> While doing a research, it is important to have an audience always in mind, so that we know how the audience can benefit from a study.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Narrowing down research questions: </b> Research questions shouldn't be too broad as well as not too specific. The list of appropraite research questions should also be as concise as possible to avoid questionnaire length.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Ideal research question should therefore adhere to the following features:</b> 
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Clear: A question has to be clear in order to effectively pursue research issue.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Focused: So that it measures what it is meant to be measured.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Complexity: The questions should not be too complex as well as not too simple.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Researchable. Access to suitable amount of quality research materials.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Analytical rather than descriptive.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

    <div id="slow-trans" class="FirstSection" style="margin-bottom: 7vh;">
      <div class="alignLeft">
        <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 3</p>
        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In unit 3, we explored detailed concepts of methodology and research methods. This allowed us to understand the importance of a well prepared research design, including the need to choose an appropriate approach for our study. Therefore, the two main research designs we focused on were:  </p>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Exploratory Research:</b> Refers to the understanding of a problem that is not clearly defined. Instead of having an conclusive research, the focus is on understanding and acknowledging a problem. For example, this approach is common when a certain company wants to investigate the effectiveness of customer relationship management in marketing. </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Conclusive Research:</b> In contrast to the above approach, this one focuses on finding and providing information that leads to decisions. In nature it tends to be quantitative, where we perform descriptive and inferential statistics.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Together with different research approaches we were able to address the difference between qualitative, quantitative and mixed type of methods: </p>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Interviews:</b> This approach is one of the most common when conducting qualitative research. It is a personal interview usually carried out with one person at a time. An interview is based on the conversation which allows one to obtain in-depth details from respondents while at the same time body language also helps to reveal communicational dynamic. </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Survey Design:</b> Nowadays, the most commonly used quantitative tool for research is the online survey. This approach utilizes the ease of access to a larger group of people at a lower cost. Its purpose is to achieve a high response rate in a relatively short amount of time compared to an interview. However, a questionnaire typically contains closed-ended questions, so an in-depth analysis of one participant's opinion is not prioritized.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">The importance of pre and post testing refers to the measuring of how well certain outcome can be beneficial. For example, a well-defined research question will lead to desired outcomes, while on the other hand, interview questions might rise new questions that were not initially considered which can then be followed up in a second (post) interview. </p>

          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Data collection methods were the main focus of the fourth week. The following types are the most common approaches when we consider the data gathering, measuring and analysis: </p><b style="color: black; margin-left: 0em;" class="boldBlack"></b>

          <p class="boldBlack" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">The main focus was on Pylint, which checks for errors in Python code. Pylint looks for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer details about the code’s complexity (Choudhary, 2020).</p><b style="color: black; margin-left: 0em;" class="boldBlack"><a href="./Homework/Pylint%20activity.docx" download="" style="color: black"><b class="boldBlack red-color-style">Unit - 5: Codio activity - Pylint</b></a></b>

        <ul style="color:black;" class="remove-all-styles">
          In unit 7 we discussed Operating Systems (OS) and their relationships to programming languages and security. Most applications need to interact with the underlying operating system – whether it is to pick up input from a keyboard (or other input device) or to output data to a display. There are also security implications because such interactions often require the user application to link with software libraries – either supplied by the OS provider or a third party.

		<p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">
			For the finall assignment, we also created a bash script, that we used to test execution of multiple POST requests simultaneously.
			This allowed us to simulate the cluster scalability in the case of facing heavy traffic over the website.
