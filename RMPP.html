        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-left: 0px;">In the first week, we got introduced to various research methods and practices that allowed us to understand the purpose of researches' as well as how to follow best practices while conducting one. Furthermore, main focus was on understanding the discipline itself, so that future work could be properly attained. Therefore the focus was on understanding the following concepts, methods and terms:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Deduction: </b>Defined as logical approach where a research goes from general ideas to specific conclusions. It's an approach to rest existing theory.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Induction: </b>In contrast to the deductive approach, the inductive aims to go from specific observations to broader generalization, therefore, this approach allows us to generate and develop new theory.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Key Principles of Research Ethics: </b>
              <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Respect: </b> This is one of the main research ethics principle, as it applies directly to the participants of a research. As a researchers, we should be aware that making participants anonymous is crucial, in order to avoid any sensitive data disclosure. In addition, their decision to participate should be voluntary and respected with all regards.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Beneficence: </b> Is the balance between research benefits and risks inflicted on participants. As researchers, we should therefore strive to minimize the latter and maximize the former.</li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Justice: </b> Refers to the fair treatment of all participants. For example, this can be easily violated if the sample is not properly acquired. </li>
                <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack">Respect for Law & Public Interest: </b> Refers to the legal obligations that a researcher should adhere to. This allows one to make an research that holds to the well established standards, ultimately enhancing it's validity.</li>
                
              </ul>
            </li>

      <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 2</p>
      
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%; text-align: justify;">In unit 2, we examined the purpose
          of literature reviews and research proposals which helped us to follow best practices during research.
          We began by focusing on research questions, which are central part to any research project. These questions should therefore be focused, clear and concise. Their primary purpose is to guide the writing process, ensuring a structured and coherent content.</p>
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%; text-align: justify;">Guidlines when considering research design and its questions:</p>

        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;margin-left: 1.5em;">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Relevant context: </b> When doing a research we should consider our own situation and the purpose of doing certain research. Therefore, the content should be ideally related to the topic of our profession.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Interesting and appropriate topic: </b> A researcher should ideally take the topic in which he feels genuine interest, as this would allow him to delve into the details of that topic.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Preliminary research: </b> A preliminary research should be done to assess what has been done so far. Additionally, this would help one to narrow down the questions and dive into an unexplored or not so well supported findings.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Audience: </b> While doing a research, it is important to have an audience always in mind, so that we know how the audience can benefit from a study.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Narrowing down research questions: </b> Research questions shouldn't be too broad as well as not too specific. The list of appropraite research questions should also be as concise as possible to avoid questionnaire length.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack">Ideal research question should therefore adhere to the following features:</b> 
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 1vh;">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Clear: A question has to be clear in order to effectively pursue research issue.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Focused: So that it measures what it is meant to be measured.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Complexity: The questions should not be too complex as well as not too simple.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Researchable. Access to suitable amount of quality research materials.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;"><b class="boldBlack"></b> Analytical rather than descriptive.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

    <div id="slow-trans" class="FirstSection" style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
      <div class="alignLeft">
        <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 3</p>
        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In unit 3, we explored detailed concepts of methodology and research methods. This allowed us to understand the importance of a well prepared research design, including the need to choose an appropriate approach for our study. Therefore, the two main research designs we focused on were:  </p>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Exploratory Research:</b> Refers to the understanding of a problem that is not clearly defined. Instead of having an conclusive research, the focus is on understanding and acknowledging a problem. For example, this approach is common when a certain company wants to investigate the effectiveness of customer relationship management in marketing. </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Conclusive Research:</b> In contrast to the above approach, this one focuses on finding and providing information that leads to decisions. In nature it tends to be quantitative, where we perform descriptive and inferential statistics.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Together with different research approaches we were able to address the difference between qualitative, quantitative and mixed type of methods: </p>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Interviews:</b> This approach is one of the most common when conducting qualitative research. It is a personal interview usually carried out with one person at a time. An interview is based on the conversation which allows one to obtain in-depth details from respondents while at the same time body language also helps to reveal communicational dynamic. </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Survey Design:</b> Nowadays, the most commonly used quantitative tool for research is an online survey. This approach easily reaches larger group of people at a lower cost. Its purpose is to achieve best possible response rate in a relatively short amount of time compared to an interview. However, a questionnaire typically contains close-ended questions, so an in-depth analysis of one participant's opinion is not often available.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">The importance of pre and post testing refers to the measuring of how well certain outcome can be beneficial. For example, a well-defined research question will lead to desired outcomes, while on the other hand, interview questions might rise new questions that were not initially considered which can then be followed up in a second (post) interview. </p>

        <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 4</p>
        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Data collection methods were the main focus of the fourth week. The following types are the most common approaches when we consider the data gathering, measuring and analysis: </p><b style="color: black; margin-left: 0em;" class="boldBlack"></b>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Case Studies:</b> Case studies are comprised of in-depth research and study of individuals or groups. More than often, case studies allow us to test hypothesis and widen a further scope of studying a phenomenon. The case studies however, shouldn't be used to determine causes and effects. That's because there is high chance of bias induced either by the participant selection, sampling or the researcher itself. </li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Focus Groups:</b> Similarly, focus groups aim to explore insights about a topic, whereas multiple participants collaborate and discuss within group setting. The groups usually comprise of 6-10 people who share common backgrounds, experiences and are representative of a targeted audience.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Quantitative Observation:</b> Refers to observation of numerical values. It is statistical approach where we perform numerical analysis based on the data collected.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Qualitative Observation:</b> This approach focuses on in-depth understanding of a phenomen. the researcher can choose to be either a complete observer, an observer as a participant, a participant as an observer, or a full participant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;"> In this unit we also examined the importance of ethical issues that may arise during a research. The case study which we were provided with allowed us to delve into some of the real world examples of how harmful a research can be to a society. For that purpose we examined some of the research ethics, designed to guide any researcher:</p><b style="color: black; margin-left: 0em;" class="boldBlack"></b>
          <ul style="color:black;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Social Responsibility:</b> Strive to promote social good and prevent or mitigate social harms through research, public education, and advocacy.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Honesty :</b> Honestly report data, results, methods and procedures, and publication status. Do not fabricate, falsify, or misrepresent data.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Objectivity:</b> Strive to avoid bias in experimental design, data analysis, data interpretation, peer review, personnel decisions, grant writing, expert testimony, and other aspects of research.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Integrity:</b> Keep your promises and agreements; act with sincerity; strive for consistency of thought and action.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Carefulness:</b> Avoid careless errors and negligence; carefully and critically examine your own work and the work of your peers. Keep good records of research activities.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Openness:</b> Share data, results, ideas, tools, resources. Be open to criticism and new ideas.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Respect for Intellectual Property:</b> Honor patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property. Do not use unpublished data, methods, or results without permission. Give credit where credit is due. Never plagiarize.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Confidentiality:</b> Protect confidential communications, such as papers or grants submitted for publication, personnel records, trade or military secrets, and patient records.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 0em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;"> In addition, the following misconducts were also the case in that week's case study activity:</p><b style="color: black; margin-left: 0em;" class="boldBlack"></b>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 2vh;" class="hyphen1">
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Fabrication:</b> making up data or results and recording or reporting them.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Falsification:</b> manipulating research materials, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.</li>
            <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Plagiarism:</b> the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.</li>

        <p id="boldStyle" class="colorStyle">Unit 5</p>
        <div>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Objectives that were covered in unit 5 include understanding the difference between questionnaire and survey. While the latter refers to a method used for gathering and analysing the data, the former refers to the questions with answers used to conduct a survey. A questionnaire is therefore a research instrument which purpose is to gain information from respondents usually carried out online, over the phone or face-to-face. The most common type of questions are closed-ended with Likert scale as a rating scale to measure respondents' opinions. Other topics that were covered in this unit include:</p>
          <ul style="color:black;">
            <li>Interview methods and survey methods </li>
            <li>Population vs sample definition</li>
            <li>concept of pre and post testing</li>
            <li>Understanding the different methods of obtaining responses and enhancing the responses quality</li>
            <li>Analysing the responses from different types of question</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldBlack" style="font-weight: bolder;margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Preliminary decisions in questionnaire design:</p>
          <div>
          <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 2vh;" class="hyphen1">
            <li>Decide the information required </li>
            <li>Define the target respondents</li>
            <li>Choose the method(s) of reaching your target respondents</li>
            <li>Decide on question content</li>
            <li>Develop the question wording</li>

            <li>Pre-test the questionnaire</li>
            <li>Develop the final survey form</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
            <p class="boldBlack" style="font-weight: bolder;margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Questionnaires are a cheap way to obtain large amounts of data relatively quickly. However, response rates are usually very low, therefore some of the tips should be considered during the design phase:</p>
          
            <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 2vh;" class="hyphen1">
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Leading Question:</b> A leading question will influence the way in which your respondent answers your question. You may be using language that suggests how they should answer or you have given too few options for them to choose from. To overcome this second point it is sensible to always include an ‘other’ option.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Assumptive Question:</b> Do not assume anything about your respondent. You do not know if they drink alcohol, work out or are a native English speaker. Set the scene with your questions before asking for more specific or specialist information.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Pushy Question:</b> This is similar to a leading question as you are trying to get them to answer in a certain way. Often this is due to an unconscious selection of options for them to choose from. A good pilot study will highlight these questions.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Confusing Question:</b> Avoid double negatives; avoid negatives completely as they tend to be confusing to the respondent. Try to make them as logical as possible. It helps if your questions are listed in a logical manner.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Random Question:</b> A respondent will pick up on a random question and start to question the integrity of the questionnaire as often these questions tend to be in the interest of some third party.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Double-barrelled Question:</b> When asking a question, make sure you are only asking for one answer. It is easy to put two issues into one statement but then it is not possible for your respondent to give one answer.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> The Ambiguous Question:</b> This will often happen when your questionnaire is covering something very specialist. Make sure the language you use is understood by your respondents. Most of the above can be avoided by doing a good pilot survey.</li>

        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In unit 6 we examined Descriptive statistics. This week's lecture was particularly interesting as we got introduced to practical examples of the use of statistics in quantitative researches'. Through quantitative methods we were able to examine relationship between variables and apply other descriptive statistics to get an initial representation of the variables. This allowed us to explore the data  and summarize its content in some meaningful way. </p>
        <p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">Common statistical metrics:</p>
        
        <ul style="color:black;margin-bottom: 2vh;" class="hyphen1">
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Mean:</b> Also called the mathematical average of a given data set, can be found by adding all values in the data set, and dividing by the number of values.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Mode:</b> The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a data set.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Median:</b> The median is the midpoint value of a given data set. In cases where the midpoint values are two (when the number of data points is even), you need to find the average of both middle values.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Range:</b> The range is the difference between a given data set's highest and lowest values. It helps us to know how wide the data is.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Quartiles and the interquartile range:</b> A quartile is a type of quantile that divides an ordered data set into four parts (quarters), where the interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile value.</li>
          <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Variance and standard deviation:</b> The variance is the measure of how data points vary from the mean, and the standard deviation is the square root of variance. What this tells us is that standard deviation is derived from variance.</li>

        <ul style="color:black;" class="remove-all-styles">In unit 7, we discussed Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing. ‘The goal of inferential statistics is to discover some property or general pattern about a large group by studying a smaller group of people in the hopes that the results will generalize to the larger group.’ (Purdue University, n.d.). The main purpose of interential statistics is to extract meaningful and useful information to make valid inferences from underlying population. To be able to extract meaningful and usefull information, we had to examine levels of measurement:<li class="remove-all-styles" style="margin-top: 0.5em;">

              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Ratio Scale:</b> The data in a variable that has a ratio scale of measurement are genuine measures of quantity, hence numeric. Differences between values of such a variable are meaningful.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Interval Scale:</b> In contrast to the ratio scale, interval holds equal ratios and allows the values to go below zero. For example, height and weight are common ratio measurements while temperature is represented by interval scale.</li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Ordinal Scale:</b> A variable has an ordinal scale of measurement if the order or “ranking” of its numerical values is meaningful, but differences between these values are not. For example, rating attractiveness of a certain thing, can be measured on the scale from 1-5, where 1 means strong dislike and 5 strong like. </li>
              <li style="padding-right: 2vh;font-weight: 500;"><b class="boldBlack"> Ordinal Scale:</b> A nominal scale represents a simple classification or labelling of each observation. Typical nominal variables include: Maritial status, Religious affiliation, Occupation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the above scales, visual presentation also plays important role. As for example, bar charts are used together with qualitative type of data (ordinal and nominal) as well as discrete quantitative data. On the other hand, histograms are well known visual presentations of quantitative continuous data (Interval, ratio scales).</p>

		<p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">In this week, we were introduced to multiple different encryption algorithms
			that we were able to use in our final assignment.
			The topic was even more important, as it enabled us to understand how encryption works within the systems.</p>

			In unit 9, we acquired practical Python developing skills that supported our summative assessment.
			During that week’s materials, we created an API, and used it to demonstrate CRUD capabilities.
		</p>
		<p class="boldBlack" style="margin-bottom: 1em;padding-right: 2%;padding-left: 0px;">
			For the finall assignment, we also created a bash script, that we used to test execution of multiple POST requests simultaneously.
			This allowed us to simulate the cluster scalability in the case of facing heavy traffic over the website.
